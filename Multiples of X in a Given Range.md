# Multiples of X in a Given Range

Fork this repository and solve the following problem.
---

You are given a list of integers arr containing N elements and an integer X.  
Your task is to print all elements in the list that are divisible by X.

Important Constraints:  
The use of loops (for, while, etc.) is strictly prohibited.  
The solution must be implemented using recursion only.

Note - It is guaranteed that the given list contains at least one element that is divisible by X.

## Input
The first line of input contains a single integer N, representing the number of elements in the list.  
The second line of input contains N space-separated integers, representing the elements of the list.  
The third line of input contains a single integer X.

Example Input:
5  
2 3 4 6 9  
3

## Output
Print all elements of the list that are divisible by X, separated by a single space.

Example Output:
3 6 9
