# Sum the odd elements

Fork this repository and solve the following problem.
---

Given an integer array arr of size N, your task is to compute the sum of the odd elements in the array.

Constraints & Rules  
Array indices are 0-based.  
This is a functional problem.  
You must solve this problem using recursion only.  
Use of loops (for, while) is strictly not allowed.  
No built-in functions like sum() should be used.

## Input

User Task  
Since this is a functional problem, you do not need to take input. Your task is to complete the function odd_sum() that takes an integer array arr as an input parameter.

Custom Input  
The first line of input contains an integer N, representing the number of elements in the array.  
The second and final line of input contains N space-separated integers, representing the elements of the array.

Example Input:
5  
2 10 3 7 8

## Output
Return an integer representing the sum of the odd elements.

Example Output:
10
